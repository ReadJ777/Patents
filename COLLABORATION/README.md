## 🎯 Patent Overview

**USPTO Application:** 63/967,611  
**Title:** ZIME Ternary Computing System with Kernel-Level PSI-State Exploitation  
**Status:** Provisional Filed (May 2025) | Continuation Ready ($320)

### One-Sentence Summary

ZIME introduces a third computational state (PSI/Ψ) that allows systems to **defer uncertain decisions** instead of forcing potentially wrong binary choices—saving 28-36% energy and eliminating cascade failures.
