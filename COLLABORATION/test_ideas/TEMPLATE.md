## Hypothesis

What do you expect this test to prove or disprove?

Example: "I hypothesize that ZIME's PSI detection will fail under extremely high-frequency signal changes (>1MHz)."

## Test Description

Describe the test in detail:
- What inputs?
- What parameters?
- What environment?
- What measurements?

## Success Criteria

What results would validate your hypothesis?

Example: 
- If PSI detection rate drops below 10% at 1MHz signals → hypothesis validated
- If PSI detection maintains >25% at 1MHz → hypothesis refuted

## Failure Criteria

What results would refute your hypothesis?

## Relevance to Patent

Which patent claim does this test support or challenge?

Reference: See `PROVISIONAL_2/CLAIMS.md` for claim list.

## Additional Notes

Any other context, concerns, or suggestions.
