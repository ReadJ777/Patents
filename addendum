# ZIME TECHNOLOGIES: TECHNICAL ADDENDUM & DEFENSIVE PUBLICATION
**Date:** February 6, 2026
**Inventor:** JaKaiser Smith
**Related Application:** USPTO Non-Provisional (Filed Jan 2026)
**Subject:** Cross-Platform Embodiments (Windows/Hypervisor) and AGI Hallucination Defense

## NOTICE OF PRIOR ART
This document serves as a public disclosure and defensive publication of technical extensions to the ZIME Ternary Computing System. The embodiments described herein are claimed as the intellectual property of the inventor, establishing prior art against subsequent filings by third parties regarding uncertainty-aware resource management on Windows NT kernels, Hypervisors, and AGI inference systems.

## 1. Windows Operating System Embodiment
This section discloses the adaptation of the ZIME Ternary Computing System for the Microsoft Windows NT kernel architecture.

### A. Windows Driver Model (WDM) Power Integration
Unlike Linux `cpufreq` implementations, this embodiment interfaces directly with the **Windows Processor Power Management (PPM)** engine.
* **Mechanism:** The ZIME kernel-mode driver registers as a **Power Setting Callback** within the Windows Driver Model (WDM).
* **Trigger Logic:** When the **PSI Ratio** ($\Psi$) exceeds the configured power threshold (default $>0.8$), the driver dynamically transitions the active power scheme.
* **API Usage:** The driver utilizes the `PoRequestPowerIrp` and `PowerWriteACValueIndex` APIs to switch the system from "High Performance" to "Power Saver" or "Balanced" modes without user intervention.
* **Hardware Feedback Interface (HFI):** On supported Intel/AMD hardware (e.g., Intel Thread Director), the driver injects "Uncertainty Hints" via HFI classes, instructing the Windows Scheduler to de-prioritize threads flagged with high classification uncertainty.

### B. Metric Exposure via WMI and PerfMon
To replace the Unix-style `/proc` interface, this embodiment exposes ternary metrics via **Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)** and **Performance Counters**:
* **WMI Class:** `ZimeTernary_Performance`
* **Exposed Properties:**
    * `PsiRatio` (Float): Real-time uncertainty ratio [0.0 - 1.0].
    * `DecisionsCommitted` (UInt64): Total binary decisions finalized.
    * `TimeoutCount` (UInt32): Number of decisions forced by safe-fail timeout.
* **PerfMon Integration:** These metrics are mapped to native Windows Performance Counters, enabling real-time monitoring via `perfmon.exe` and System Center.

## 2. Hypervisor Uncertainty-Aware Scheduling (Ring -1)
This section discloses the method for managing ternary uncertainty at the virtualization layer, applicable to KVM, Hyper-V, and Xen.

### A. Per-VM PSI Tracking
The hypervisor maintains a **Shadow Control Structure** for each Guest Virtual Machine (VM) to track cognitive load versus uncertainty:
* **Metric:** `vm_psi_ratio` = (Total Guest $\Psi$-Deferrals) / (Total Guest Instructions).
* **Scheduling Algorithm:** The hypervisor scheduler (e.g., KVM CFS or Hyper-V Root Scheduler) is modified to penalize the `vruntime` (virtual runtime) of Guest VMs exhibiting a `vm_psi_ratio > 0.7`.
* **Benefit:** This prevents a VM stuck in a "Hallucination Loop" (high uncertainty) from monopolizing physical CPU cycles, preserving host integrity for stable workloads.

### B. Guest-to-Host Hypercalls
To enable "Paravirtualized Uncertainty," the following Hypercalls are defined for Guest-Host communication:
* `0x01000001`: **ZIME_GUEST_REGISTER** - Enables host-side PSI tracking for the calling Guest.
* `0x01000004`: **ZIME_FORCE_DEFERRAL** - Allows the Host to force a Guest into a paused $\Psi$-state during resource contention.

## 3. AGI Hallucination Defense System (The "Firewall")
This section discloses the specific application of ZIME Ternary Logic to Large Language Models (LLMs) and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) to prevent hallucinations.

### A. The "Hallucination Firewall" Mechanism
This embodiment acts as a physical filter between the Neural Processing Unit (NPU) and the output stream.
* **Detection:** For every token generated by the NPU, the system calculates the **Softmax Confidence Gap** between the top-1 and top-2 predicted tokens.
* **Classification Rule:** If `(Top1_Score - Top2_Score) < (2 * Delta)`, the output is immediately classified as **Psi-Uncertainty**.
* **Actionable Deferral:** The system suppresses the token output and triggers a **Deferral Event**, preventing the AGI from emitting a "guess."
* **Energy Impact:** The detection of this state triggers **Claim 6** (Power Management), instantly reducing NPU/CPU frequency to save energy while the model waits for additional context.

### B. Deterministic Verification Hash
To ensure auditability, the system generates a **SHA256 Hash** of the decision path for every inference:
* **Process:** `Hash(Input_Vector + Theta_Param + Delta_Param + Decision_State)`
* **Verification:** This hash allows external auditors to verify that the AGI's refusal to answer was a deterministic result of the ZIME logic, not a random failure or software bug.
* **Bit-Exactness:** This mechanism is proven to produce identical hashes across Linux, OpenBSD, and Windows platforms.
